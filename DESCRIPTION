Author: Samantha Oliver, Austin Baldwin

Description: This package recreates common analyses and figures to calculate biological impact and
sources of PAHs in aquatic sediments. Each individual analysis has major caveats and limitations, but 
together can be used as a weight-of-evidence approach to understand the impact and sources of PAH 
contamination in the environment.
